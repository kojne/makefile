In this project multiple scripts like fasta-unfold, find-orfs and gc-count, aswell as python script, were used to analyze and modify data from genome fasta files and provide images with useful data.

In A. E. Vinogradov's paper the genome data was collected from GeneBank.The bendability and curvature of nucleotide sequences were
determined using the trinucleotide table of consensus values
obtained from DNase I digestion and nucleosome positioning
studies. The thermostability was determined using a unified dinucleotide table for free energy of melting.
